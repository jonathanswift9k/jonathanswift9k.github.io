Server Content:
    - Maybe a model for adding job experience for the fuck of it?
        - Dates worked, position, company, responsibilities, that kind of shit
    - Need to make an email list for people to sign up for my "Newsletter" and get my resume emailed to them. Need to figure out how to manage that too. Good email design experience if it gets to that, this is probably a last step though.
    - These are probably the only two things that make any sense to store in the server

Front End Content:
    - Pages
        - Home, Past Employment, "Cover Letter" or Mission Statement, About Me, Certifications, "Reviews" (accolades, probably just show these on the home page, you know how you're imagining it) 
    - Links to my LinkedIn and Git (Probably a link to this specific repo as a "Check out my code!" type of thing). A 'Contact' link would be good.
    - Sign Up (at the very least receive a PDF copy of my email, an unsubscribe would be good to have as well just to know how to code it. Can't imagine it's any more complex than just separate route with a delete request.)
    - Really have to learn Bootstrap, the design aspect will be really important. Visualize that. Want it very clean and minimalist, nothing loud, smooth transitions, remember the website that Haraad and Dalena designed vaguely.
